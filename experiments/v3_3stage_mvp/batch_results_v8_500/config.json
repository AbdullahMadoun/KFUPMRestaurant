There are usually 2-4 separate food portions served together (e.g. a protein, a carb like rice, and a side).\n\nFor EACH distinct food portion you can see:\n1. Describe its VISUAL APPEARANCE: color, texture, shape, surface pattern, approximate size relative to the plate\n2. Provide its bounding box as [x1, y1, x2, y2] in pixel coordinates\n\nRULES:\n- Describe what you SEE, not what you think it is called\n- Look carefully for items partially hidden under or next to other items\n- A portion of rice next to a portion of meat = TWO separate items, even if touching\n- If the same type of item appears in two different places, treat them as TWO separate items with TWO separate bounding boxes\n- A mixed dish (stew, salad with mixed ingredients) = ONE item\n- Ignore plates, bowls, cutlery, wrapping, plastic wrap, background\n- Each description must be UNIQUE and specific to THIS image \u2014 describe the actual colors, textures, and shapes you see, not generic food descriptions\n- Bounding boxes must fully cover the entire food portion with some margin \u2014 it is better to have a slightly oversized box than to cut off any part of the food\n\nReturn strictly as JSON:\n{\"items\": [\n  {\"description\": \"yellowish rice grains with small orange carrot pieces, mound covering left half of plate\", \"bbox\": [x1, y1, x2, y2]},\n  {\"description\": \"dark brown glazed meat pieces with irregular chunky shape, right side of plate\", \"bbox\": [x1, y1, x2, y2]},\n  ...\n]}\nReturn ONLY the JSON."
